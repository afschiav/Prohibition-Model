Abstract:

This paper presents an agent-based model of illicit markets. The prohibition model embodies a "bottom-up"
approach to the analysis of underground markets, capitalizing on the abilities of agent-modeling in
generating macro results based on micro interactions. This approach varies from most other studies of
illegal economies in that it does not rely exclusively on data - which are difficult to come by due to the
nature of black markets - but rather a set of assumptions backed by extensive empirical evidence. The model
is able to illustrate various illicit market properties, such as the tendency of price to fall with increased
prohibition, socioeconomic segregation patters, and effects of incarceration on poverty concentration.
